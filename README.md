# Power_Plant_Financing Project


This project uses fixed and variable costs of a Nuclear power plant, and generates financial indicator values such as:
- Levelized unit energy cost
- Break even year of project
- Net Present Value of project
- Internal Rate of Return of project
etc.


Files:
- The 'input' folder contains files for constant and variable costs of the power plant.
-The impact of change in the variable inputs (e.g., cost of fuel, plant efficiency, hour of operation etc.) will be available in the 'output' folder.
- The 'script' folder contains the code.


Calculation assumptions:
1. Nominal interest rate includes considerations of future inflation rate, opportunity cost, deferred use discounting etc.
2. Payback via 28 Equal payment, with interest enacted on remaining amount
3. The default plant capacity factor is taken as 92%


Further scope:
1. Inclusion of the impact of exchange rate
2. Comparison with alternate power sources
